## pre-course final project:
 link to the solution: https://github.com/DanielWG1/pre-course-2021-final-boilerplate/src
 In my project I made a persistant to-do list. In my project you can add as many tasks as you want to your list. 
 You can set the priority of each task and afterwards you can sort them by their priority. 
 Also you can delete your tasks or even mark them as done without deleting them.
 Another two things that I added are the counter which counts how many tasks are in the list, and the second thing is a spinner that appears when the page is loading.
 The most important part in my work is that every little detail is persist. All the marks, adding deleting etc. So you can open your list in any browser or computer and it will show you the latest updated list.

 The project is separated to four sections: HTML, CSS, MAIN JS which belongs mostly to the UI and a DATA JS tha belongs to the browser (with the MAIN JS).

## List of bonuses
 - Works with JSONbin and everything is persistant.
 - Can delete tasks.
 - Can mark tasks as done or undone.
 - The cursor becomes a "spinner" when loading page and returns to default afterwards.
